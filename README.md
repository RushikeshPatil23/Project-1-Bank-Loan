## Key Performance Indicators

### Year-wise Loan Amount Stats
- Growth Trend: There is a steady and significant increase in the loan amount issued from 2007 (2M) to 2011 (261M), suggesting a robust expansion in lending activities over these years.
- Economic Confidence: The increasing loan amounts year-over-year may indicate growing confidence in the economy, encouraging both the bank to lend more and customers to borrow more.

### Grade and Sub-Grade Wise Revolving Balance
- Credit Quality Distribution: The revolving balance is spread across different grades and sub-grades, providing insight into the distribution of credit quality among borrowers.
- Risk Management: Understanding the revolving balance by grade helps in identifying potential risk areas. Higher balances in lower grades may signal higher risk concentrations.

### Total Payment for Verified Status vs. Total Payment for Non-Verified Status
- Higher Payments from Verified Customers: Verified customers account for 68.19% of the total payments (329.16M), which indicates that verified customers tend to pay more compared to non-verified customers.
- Verification Impact: With 57.40% of customers verified, the significant payment contribution from verified customers underscores the importance of customer verification in securing repayments.

### State-wise and Last Credit Pull Date-wise Loan Status
- Geographical Distribution: Loans are dispersed across various states with a mix of loan statuses (Charged Off, Current, Fully Paid), highlighting regional differences in loan performance and potential areas of concern.
- Credit Monitoring: The last credit pull date data can help in monitoring the timeliness of credit reviews and identifying patterns in loan performance relative to the recency of credit checks.

### Home Ownership vs. Last Payment Date Stats
- Mortgage Holders Lead in Payments: Customers with mortgages have the highest sum of last payment amounts (56.31M), indicating their higher borrowing and repayment capacities.
- Payment Regularity: The last payment dates clustered around recent years (mostly 2016) for different home ownership categories suggest that most borrowers are current with their payments, providing a positive indication of repayment behaviour.

These insights can help in making informed decisions on lending strategies, risk management, and customer verification processes.

### Conclusion:

The Bank Loan Performance Dashboard project has delivered crucial insights essential for strategic decision-making and operational efficiency within our lending practices. It has highlighted a significant increase in loan amounts from 2007 to 2011, indicative of growing economic confidence and expanding lending activities.

Moreover, the analysis of credit quality distribution by grade and sub-grade has provided insights into risk concentrations among borrowers, guiding targeted risk management efforts. The dashboard's findings on payment behaviours linked to customer verification underscore the importance of robust verification processes in ensuring timely repayments and minimizing defaults.

Furthermore, regional analyses have identified geographic variations in loan statuses and payment behaviours, informing tailored lending strategies to better meet diverse customer needs. Overall, these insights equip us to optimize loan management, mitigate risks effectively, and enhance customer service, positioning us for sustained growth and value creation.
