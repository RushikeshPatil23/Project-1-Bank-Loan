  over the years, by the end of this project, we will find out the important insights like top states to take loans, top reasons to take loans, the percentage of customers who paid the loans back and many 
  other which will help the bank improve their loan system.

### Dataset - Bank loan of customers

### Tools 

  - Excel - Data Cleaning and creating Dashboard
  - SQl   - Solving Key Performance indicators(KPIs)
  - Power Bi - Dashboard Creation
  - Tableau - Dashboard Creation

### Excel
  - Opened the .csv file that was provided and since we have two files we imported the second file using Query and created a relationship between both files using 
    the ID column.
  - started to read and understand the data, after that cleaned and modified the data a bit and deleted some unwanted values.
  - After the data was ready I started working on the KPIs which were to be included in the dashboard I was going to create (KPIs were Provided by the EXCELR 
    Institute).
  - Then I started creating pivot tables for the KPIs once the pivot tables were ready I simply converted those tables into different charts.
  - On the new sheet I pasted all the charts and created a dashboard.

  - Then imported the .CSV files with the import wizard
  - Then using SQl solve the Queries

  - Used PowerPoint to create a background image for the dashboard and then arranged the charts accordingly to complete the dashboard.
